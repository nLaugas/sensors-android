SENSORS ANDROID

The app sends sensors' data via bluetooth. These sensors are  gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer.
If the gyroscope  sensor is not available in the smartphone, then they are simulated through the use of two sensors. 
These sensors are magnetometer and accelerometer. 


A proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller or three-term controller) is a control loop feedback mechanism widely used in industrial control systems and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control. A PID controller continuously calculates an error value {\displaystyle e(t)} e(t) as the difference between a desired setpoint (SP) and a measured process variable (PV) and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms (denoted P, I, and D respectively), hence the name.
